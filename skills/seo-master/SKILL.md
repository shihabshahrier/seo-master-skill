# SEO Master Skill (SEO + GEO + AEO, 2026)

Battle-tested playbook distilled from optimizing a real SaaS (letx.app, a
collaborative LaTeX editor) against AI-native competitors. Everything here is
applied knowledge, not theory.

## The one-paragraph mental model

In 2026 there are **two audiences**: classic search crawlers (Google, Bing) and
**AI answer engines** (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, Copilot). They
overlap but differ. SEO ranks you in a list of links. **GEO/AEO gets you cited
inside an AI's generated answer.** A solid SEO foundation is required for both;
AEO/GEO adds: answer-first writing, dense structured data (especially FAQPage),
fact density, freshness, and being present where each AI grounds its search.
Critically — **each AI uses a different search index**, so "getting indexed" is
not one task but several.

## How to use this skill

1. **Detect the stack first** (`package.json` → Next.js App/Pages Router, React
   SPA, Astro, Remix…). Implementation differs by render model. See
   `references/framework-seo.md`.
2. Read `references/ai-engines-and-indexes.md` — determines *where* to optimize.
   Wrong index = invisible to that AI. (Coding agents like Claude Code / Codex /
   OpenClaw / Hermes mostly ground on **Brave**.)
3. Skim `references/whats-new-2026.md` for the I/O 2026 + May core-update context
   (AI Mode on Gemini 3.5 Flash; "AEO/GEO is still SEO"; llms.txt is optional).
4. Run the audit in `references/implementation-checklist.md` against the site.
5. Fix in priority order: indexing reach → structured data → answer-first
   content → titles/meta → content moat.
6. Use `references/search-console-setup.md` for Google + Bing + IndexNow, and
   `references/structured-data.md` / `references/content-and-aeo.md` as
   copy/paste references while implementing.

## Reference files (read as needed)

| File | What's in it |
|------|--------------|
| `references/ai-engines-and-indexes.md` | Which index each AI + coding agent uses (Brave/Bing/Google), how each cites, per-engine tactics |
| `references/framework-seo.md` | Detect the stack; Next.js App Router Metadata API (`metadata`/`generateMetadata`, sitemap/robots/OG conventions, render modes) + Pages Router + React SPA |
| `references/whats-new-2026.md` | Google I/O 2026, May 2026 core update, "AEO/GEO still SEO", llms.txt contested, AI-Mode query shift |
| `references/structured-data.md` | Every schema type with ready JSON-LD: FAQPage, HowTo, Course, SoftwareApplication, Article, Breadcrumb, ItemList, Product. Policy rules (fake ratings). |
| `references/titles-and-meta.md` | Title formula, the brand-suffix decision, meta description, OG/Twitter, canonical |
| `references/content-and-aeo.md` | Answer-first writing, fact density, FAQ pattern, content hubs, the "problems/errors" play, courses |
| `references/technical-seo.md` | Prerendering SPAs, sitemap, robots.txt + Content-Signals, llms.txt, code-splitting, Core Web Vitals, canonical/redirects |
| `references/search-console-setup.md` | Google Search Console, Bing Webmaster Tools + AI Performance, IndexNow (Cloudflare + script), submission steps |
| `references/competitor-and-positioning.md` | How to research competitors, find the open lane, off-site listicle strategy |
| `references/implementation-checklist.md` | Prioritized, copy-paste audit + execution checklist |
| `references/gsc-diagnostics-and-recovery.md` | Diagnose a site FROM Search Console data: brand/non-brand segmentation, striking-distance vs page-2 cohorts, slash-pair detection, the prerendered-SPA canonical trap + fix recipe, CTR surgery that still works in 2026, CLS quick wins, verification curl checks |

## Hard rules (learned the hard way)

- **Never fabricate `aggregateRating`/reviews in schema.** Google structured-data
  policy violation → manual action. Only use rating schema backed by visible,
  real on-page reviews. Use `featureList` / plain claims instead.
- **Never copy a competitor's stat.** ("20M users" belonged to Overleaf, not us —
  caught and removed.) Every claim must be true and yours.
- **Title ≤ 60 chars** or Google truncates. Long brand descriptors don't fit on
  content pages — use a short `| Brand` suffix there.
- **FAQ schema requires the FAQ to be visible on the page.** Schema-only FAQ =
  policy risk. Always render the questions AND emit JSON-LD.
- **Code-split heavy content** (course data, KaTeX, etc.) so the main JS bundle
  every visitor downloads stays small. Prerendered HTML keeps full content for
  SEO regardless.
- **IndexNow does NOT notify Google** — only Bing/Yandex/DuckDuckGo/etc. Google
  uses its own crawl + Search Console.
- **Detect the framework before implementing.** Next.js App Router uses the
  Metadata API (`metadata`/`generateMetadata`) — not helmet, not prerender. Only
  hand-rolled React SPAs need the Puppeteer prerender. Wrong tool = wasted work.
- **Don't over-optimize for AI citations.** The May 2026 core update appears to
  demote shallow answer-bait. Depth + real E-E-A-T + genuine fact density win;
  thin Q&A spam is now a risk, not a hack.
- **llms.txt is optional, low priority** — Google says it "isn't needed for AI
  Search." Add it only if cheap; never before content/schema/indexing.
- **Exactly ONE canonical per page, verified with curl on the deployed site.**
  Prerendered SPAs bake the static index.html canonical into every page and
  helmet adds a second — both wrong. The crawler reads baked HTML, not your
  DevTools. (Found live on a 500-user product; suppressed the whole site.)
- **Trailing slash: standardize on whatever the HOST redirects to** (Cloudflare
  Pages 308s to slash). Canonicals, sitemap, og:url, and internal hrefs must all
  use that one form, or GSC splits impressions across slash pairs.
- **Segment GSC before concluding anything.** Blended CTR/position lie: split
  brand vs non-brand, pos 4–15 (snippet problem) vs pos >15 (content-depth
  problem). New-content launches drop blended metrics mechanically — mix shift,
  not a penalty.
- **FAQ rich results no longer show for normal sites** (gov/health only since
  2023). Keep FAQPage for AI citation; for SERP CTR use title/meta rewrites and
  ItemList-with-images on collection pages instead.
- **Don't merge "duplicates" reflexively.** Two pages at pos 5–6 for one query =
  double SERP presence (keep + differentiate); and near-identical slugs may be
  genuinely different products — verify content before 301ing.

## The priority order (highest ROI first)

1. **Indexing reach** — be in Google, Bing, and Brave indexes; wire IndexNow.
   (Feeds ChatGPT via Bing, Claude via Brave.)
2. **Structured data** — FAQPage on every page that can carry it (~3.2× AI
   Overview citation). Plus SoftwareApplication/Product/Article/HowTo.
3. **Answer-first content** — direct answer in first 40–60 words; 134–167-word
   self-contained passages.
4. **Titles/meta** — consistent, keyword-first, ≤60 chars.
5. **Content moat** — guides/tutorials/error-fix hub targeting the long-tail
   the competitor monetizes.
6. **Off-site** — get listed in the "alternatives" listicles AI engines cite.
